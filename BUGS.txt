Title: There is no limit for buying or selling items

Summary: There is no character limit for selling items. The user is able to sell more items than what he actually has on the portfolio.

Steps:
- Access to https://glacial-reef-23457.herokuapp.com/ > Select any option from 'Mis inversiones' list
- Add '100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000' to 'Vender' field > Click 'Realizar Venta'
- Check 'Mis Inversiones' > 'Caja de ahorro' 

Result: There is no character nor amount limits when selling items. The user is able to sell more items than what he actually has on the portfolio. Hence, 'Caja de ahorro' amount shows a negative and exponential number ($ -1,2625e+47 in this case) or it keeps on loading indefinitely   

Expected: User shouldn't be able to sell more items than the ones on his portfolio.

Notes:
- This also happens when buying items, but huge number is displayed under 'Mi Portfolio'
