Title: Consider implementing a 'Vender Todos' option.

As a User, I want to be able to have the option to sell all my actions/bonus so that I don't have to input the amount manually.

AC: 
- A 'Vender total' checkbox is displayed next to 'Vender' field
- If 'Vender total' checkbox is selected 'Realizar Venta' button is displayed.
- If 'Vender total' checkbox is selected and the user clicks 'Realizar Venta' button, all the action/bonuses of that type are sell
- After selling all the action/bonuses of that type, 'Mi Portfolio' section is displayed accordingly, and the action/bonus type is not displayed anymore.
