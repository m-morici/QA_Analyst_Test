# QA Analyst Test

## Test Cases
Please consider that the test cases on the TestCases.xlsx file are grouped by Test Suite and by TestCase, so in order to read them, you'll have to click the '+' on the left side of the screen. 
I'm also pasting here the Google Sheet link for easy access (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a3pBJ9I-PARRZt0K0VQRC1ro5kXaJ3FJrbFe8fz0imQ/edit?usp=sharing)
